<s>Clinton Lifts Yugoslavia Sanctions</s>
<s>WASHINGTON (AP )  Celebrating the political rebirth of the people of Serbia , President Clinton lifted key trade and economic sanctions to demonstrate support for Belgrade 's newly installed government .</s>
<s>``The victory of freedom in Serbia is one of the most hopeful developments in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall ,'' the president said on Friday . ``It ended a dictatorship and it can liberate an entire region from the nagging fear that ethnic differences can again be exploited to start wars and shift borders .''</s>
<s>Clinton announced the immediate ending of the oil embargo and flight ban that were imposed in 1998 to punish and isolate the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic .</s>
<s>``The removal of these sanctions is a first step to ending Serbia 's isolation ,'' Clinton said in a written statement .</s>
<s>James C. O'Brien , the senior U.S. official overseeing developments in the Balkans , met with new Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica in Belgrade on Thursday to offer congratulations on Kostunica 's election victory and to highlight the message that further progress is expected .</s>
<s>Clinton acted just days after the European Union lifted it s own oil embargo and ban on commercial flights to and from Serbia , the principal Yugoslav republic .</s>
<s>``We have a strong interest in supporting Yugoslavia 's newly elected leaders as they work to build a truly democratic society ,'' Clinton said .</s>
<s>The EU did not remove sanctions that froze overseas assets of Milosevic and his allies and prohibited them from traveling to 15 EU nations .</s>
<s>Clinton said the United States would also ensure that the lifting of sanctions does not allow Milosevic 's supporters ``to continue the systematic theft of resources that have marked the last 13 years .''</s>
<s>``Our disagreement was with the Milosevic regime , not the people of Serbia who have suffered under the regime 's brutal policies ,'' the president said .</s>
<s>``In that vein we will continue to enforce a ban on travel to the United States by top members of the Milosevic regime and keep in place measures that help the new government deter a looting of the national patrimony during the current period of transition in Yugoslavia ,'' the president said .</s>
<s>He said the administration also would review restrictions on Serbia 's participation in international financial institutions ``as Serbia makes it s democratic transition and meets it s international obligations .''</s>
<s>``There is still much work ahead for the Yugoslav people and their new government : restoring confidence in the rule of law , rebuilding an honest economy , accounting for the past while building for a better future ,'' Clinton said .</s>
<s>``Thankfully , that work can now begin  without the burden of isolation and with the friendship of the American people .''</s>
