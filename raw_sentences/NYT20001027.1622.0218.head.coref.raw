<s>MICROSOFT SAYS HACKERS VIEWED SOURCE CODES</s>

<s>Computer intruders broke into Microsoft Corp. and were able to view some of the company 's source code , the basic program instructions , for a future software product , the company said Friday .</s>
<s>But the unknown culprits , who had access to some of the company 's computers for an undetermined period , were not able to view or steal the company 's crucial source code for its Windows or Office software , a company spokesman said Friday afternoon .</s>
<s>``The situation appears to be narrower than originally thought ,'' said the spokesman , Mark Murray . ``The investigation shows no evidence that the intruder gained any access to our Windows or Office products .''</s>
<s>The company said Friday that it had contacted the FBI to help track the perpetrators . The Wall Street Journal said the break-in was discovered on Wednesday and had enabled the intruders to send information back to a computer address in Russia .</s>
<s>``We 've received information from Microsoft that we are evaluating at this time , and it 's premature to say anything else ,'' said Roberta Burroughs , spokeswoman for the Seattle field office of the FBI .</s>
<s>Speaking earlier to Microsoft programmers and reporters at a seminar in Stockholm , Sweden , Steven Ballmer , the company 's chief executive , said , ``It is clear that hackers did see some of our source code ,'' Reuters and The Associated Press reported .</s>
<s>Ballmer said the burglars had not changed any software , allaying fears that a virus might be hidden inside future releases of Microsoft products .</s>
<s>``I can assure you that we know that there has been no compromise of the integrity of the source code , that it has not been modified or tampered with in any way ,'' he added .</s>
<s>Microsoft has shared some of the source code with partner companies , but in general it vigorously guards that information from outsiders . Other operating systems , which compete with Microsoft 's , are based on open source code , which allows anyone to read , and alter , the underlying code .</s>
<s>But Microsoft has rebuffed requests to open some or all of it s operating code to the public , arguing that this would hurt it s business and curtail it s incentives to develop new products .</s>
<s>The Wall Street Journal 's Web site reported Friday that hackers gained access with a software program called QAZ Trojan . That program could have infected one of the company 's computers , allowing the hackers to use other programs to gain access to Microsoft 's internal corporate network .</s>
