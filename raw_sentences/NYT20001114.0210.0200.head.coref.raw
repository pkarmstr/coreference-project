<s>PUDDING , SWEET AND NOT</s>
<s>&UR ; By MARK HULBERT &LR ; &QC ; &QL ; &UR ; c.2000 N.Y . Times News Service &LR ; &QC ; &QL ;</s>
<s>NEW YORK  Bread pudding is one of the most traditional American dishes ; cookbooks from the 18th century have recipes for it that are more or less the same as what we make today .</s>
<s>But bread pudding is also a minimalist sort of dish , no more than dry bread mixed together with milk and eggs and whatever flavor strikes the cook , and then baked until it is rich and custardy . It can be savory or sweet , and either makes a simple , interesting substitute for a standard part of the Thanksgiving meal .</s>
<s>Savory bread pudding is a luxurious side dish that can be served in place of stuffing . Or it can be the extra stuffing that everyone always wants (but not dry like the usual kind baked outside a turkey can be ).</s>
<s>My basic recipe combines the cubed bread , eggs and milk with a couple of cheeses . (If you 're desperate for oven space , bake it and then heat it just before serving , or serve it at room temperature .) You can make it without the mushrooms , too .</s>
<s>The pudding can also be varied by adding a pinch of thyme or sage , chopped nuts or cooked chestnuts , or about a cup of grated sweet potato or chopped scallions . If you want a pudding that tastes more like stuffing , just add chopped celery , onions , carrots and herbs .</s>
<s>Sweet bread pudding is made the same way , but with fewer ingredients . I use maple syrup instead of sugar for the extra flavor and moisture . You can add more spices , including a small grating of nutmeg , chopped crystallized ginger , raisins or prunes soaked in Armagnac .</s>
<s>The kind of bread you choose makes a difference . Fluffy packaged white bread disappears ; the crusts of crisp baguettes and peasant breads never become tender . For savory pudding , stick to long , wide inexpensive loaves , usually called Italian bread ; for sweet pudding , stale hallah is best . And make sure the bread is thoroughly and evenly soaked before it 's baked ; I like to submerge the bread with a weighted plate before baking . Then you don't even have to stir .</s>
