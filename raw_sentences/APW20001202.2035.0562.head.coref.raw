<s>Skepticism Greets Fox 's Border Plan</s>
<s>BROWNSVILLE , Texas (AP )  In speech after speech , Mexico President Vicente Fox argues for his dream : A free flow of workers across an open border , an international boundary that ceases to be a barrier .</s>
<s>But the 2,000-mile frontier between Mexico and the United States is delineated by steel walls and barbed wire , watched over by uniformed guards from the Border Patrol .</s>
<s>``It will never happen ,'' Rosalinda Arebalo of neighboring Matamoros , Mexico , said flatly of Fox 's dream . ``If it did , it would be a miracle .''</s>
<s>If anything , the border is closing down . The United States announced plans this fall to step up border security with 1,300 miles of road and fence , cameras and thousands of portable floodlights . From 1993 through 1999 , the number of Border Patrol agents doubled from 4,000 to 8,000 .</s>
<s>``I 'll be honest , your country isn't ready for it ,'' said Fernando Kleinfingher , a computer consultant in Tijuana , Mexico . ``It would be very hard for America to accept .''</s>
<s>``The United States will never allow an open border ,'' predicted Faustino Avalos , a 65-year-old farmer strolling home to Matamoros . ``They only want Mexicans to visit and buy things . The undocumented workers get nothing but injustice .''</s>
<s>Economists say the skepticism is well-founded .</s>
<s>``It 's a totally unrealistic proposal ,'' said Steve Bronars , a professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin . ``It's just not something that 's going to happen .''</s>
<s>Fox , who was sworn into office Friday , first pledged to open the border during a heated campaign to overturn the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party . Pressed for details after his July election , the former Coca-Cola executive revised his scheme , promising to bring Mexican wages up to U.S. standards and open the border within 10 years , although he remains vague about a schedule .</s>
<s>Economists say an unfettered flow of Mexican workers could drive wages down and strain social services to the breaking point , particularly in border states .</s>
<s>On top of that , adds El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez : ``There are safety issues of drugs , terrorists and contraband .''</s>
<s>President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were noncommittal in August meetings with Fox . And Texas Gov. George W. Bush said he supported ``a humane way '' of cracking down on migration from ``our friendly neighbor to the south .''</s>
<s>``I appreciate (Fox 's ) optimistic vision ,'' Bush said .</s>
<s>Mark Krikorian , director of the nonpartisan , Washington -based Center for Immigration Studies , believes Fox 's call for an open border is a ``bargaining chip .'' Fox will demand a porous boundary and then settle for an increase in legal migration , he predicted .</s>
<s>``He 's hoping the United States will split the difference ,'' Krikorian said .</s>
<s>It 's a good time to cut a deal . U.S. unemployment is at its lowest in three decades and there are fewer people to fill low-skilled jobs in farms , restaurants and factories .</s>
<s>That scenario rings familiar to Arebalo , 49 , who went from Matamoros to North Carolina to work in soybean fields when she was a girl . Her family needed the money and the farms needed the help .</s>
<s>Those were the days of the Bracero Program , World War II-era legislation that beckoned thousands of Mexican nationals to replenish a dwindling U.S. labor pool .</s>
<s>In 1954 , a military -style Immigration and Naturalization Service campaign called ``Operation Wetback '' drove about 1 million illegal immigrants back into Mexico . Ten years later , the Bracero Program fizzled out .</s>
<s>``Back then it was simple to get papers to work here , and you could just come across ,'' Arebalo said as she stepped off the international bridge into Brownsville 's shopping district . ``But then everything changed .''</s>
