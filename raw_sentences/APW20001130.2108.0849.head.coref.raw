<s>Britain Forces Through Consent Law</s>
<s>LONDON (AP )  After three defeats in the House of Lords , Britain 's Labor government resorted to rarely used powers Thursday to pass legislation lowering the age of consent for homosexuals from 18 to 16 .</s>
<s>House of Commons speaker Michael Martin said he was invoking the Parliament Act to force through a Sexual Offenses Bill that makes the age of consent the same for both homosexuals and heterosexuals . It became law after being given Royal Assent by Queen Elizabeth II .</s>
<s>Lawmakers in the House of Commons overwhelmingly approved the bill earlier this year , but the House of Lords this month rejected it for the third time .</s>
<s>The Lords ' powers , however , are limited to delaying legislation by blocking it and bouncing it back to the House of Commons . The Parliament Act was created to ensure that the will of the country 's elected lawmakers prevails .</s>
<s>The bill brings Britain in line with most other European Union nations .</s>
<s>``It is a reform which , in my personal view , is long overdue and is only right for a country that has a history of reform and challenging prejudice ,'' said Home Secretary Jack Straw , Britain 's top law enforcement officer .</s>
<s>``This act will help us to build a safe , just and tolerant society ,'' he added .</s>
<s>Angela Mason , director of the gay rights group Stonewall , said Parliament 's action was ``a great step toward equality .''</s>
<s>``When the history books come to be written I believe it will be seen as the moment when this country finally began to change , when lesbians and gay men started to take our place as equal members of society ,'' she said .</s>
<s>Peter Tatchell , of the group OutRage !, said : ``This victory is a welcome and historic milestone in the long struggle for gay human rights .''</s>
<s>``My only regret is that it has taken 33 years during which time hundreds of gay men have been unjustly jailed for victimless relationships .''</s>
<s>However , family values campaigner and Conservative ex-Leader of the Lords Baroness Young accused the government of behaving in a ``completely dictatorial manner '' toward Parliament .</s>
<s>Straw dismissed the criticism . ``In the circumstances I believe that the use of the Parliament Act in this case is proper and justified ,'' he said .</s>
<s>Five years ago , Parliament narrowly rejected lowering the age of consent for homosexuals to 16 , reducing it instead from 21 to 18 . Homosexual sex between adults ceased to be a crime in Britain three decades ago .</s>
