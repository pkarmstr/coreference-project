<s>Lockerbie Trial Hears Terrorist</s>
<s>AMSTERDAM , Netherlands (AP )  A Palestinian terrorist began his testimony Friday in the trial of two Libyans accused of bombing Pan Am Flight 103 , describing his role in attacks against Israel in the 1970s .</s>
<s>Mohammed Abu Talb , whose appearance at the special Scottish <FAC-e6 type="NOM"><ORG-e56 type="NOM">court< had been delayed for weeks , testified for the prosecution . He was called in an effort to discredit the defendants ' claim that his group , the Palestine Popular Struggle Front , played a role in the 1988 bombing over Lockerbie , Scotland .</s>
<s>Abu Talb , the last major prosecution witness , has been jailed in Sweden for attacks against Jewish and American targets in Europe . He has denied any involvement in the Lockerbie bombing , which killed 270 people . He admitted carrying out a terrorist attack in Denmark in 1985 that killed a Jewish civilian .</s>
<s>Defendants Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah blame Abu Talb and other Palestinians for the 1988 attack .</s>
<s>Prosecutors say the two defendants , who are alleged to be Libyan secret agents , sent a suitcase from the Mediterranean island of Malta carrying an explosives -laden cassette recorder and routed it through Frankfurt , Germany , to the doomed airliner in London .</s>
<s>Dressed in a plain dark suit and tie , Abu Talb was flanked by Scottish prison guards as he took the witness stand , separated from the public gallery by a wall of bulletproof glass . He was questioned by prosecutor Alan Turnbull .</s>
<s>The Egyptian -born Palestinian told judges that he deserted the Egyptian army in the mid-1970s , fleeing to Lebanon via Jordan with a false passport . He obtained a fake Moroccan passport before joining the Palestine Popular Struggle Front in 1974 .</s>
<s>``I undertook various missions ,'' 46-year-old Abu Talb said , describing his terrorist past against Israel . ``In the beginning , I was doing military operations , and then I went to security , after which I was the special bodyguard of the secretary-general of the organizations .''</s>
<s>The trial resumed this week after a month of delays following the disclosure that new evidence surfaced on another group , the Damascus -based Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command . The PFLP-GC , like the PPSF , was initially suspected in the Lockerbie attack .</s>
<s>On Wednesday , Scottish judges asked Syria to hand over a document that could help prove who blew up the New York -bound jetliner .</s>
<s>Defense lawyer Bill Taylor said the document contains information on German police raids of an alleged Palestinian terrorist base months before the bombing .</s>
<s>In the ``Autumn Leaves '' operation , police entered a PFLP-GC hide-out in Neuss , Germany . They found an explosive device similar to one that triggered the Pan Am explosion . The judges did not explain what the requested document contained or how it came to be in Syrian hands .</s>
