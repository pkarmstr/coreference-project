<s>SPORTS COMMENTARY : BARRY BONDS ' DESPERATE OCTOBER</s>
<s>&UR ; By DAVE ANDERSON &QC ; &LR ; &QL ; &UR ; c.2000 N.Y . Times News Service &QC ; &LR ; &QL ;</s>
<s>If Barry Bonds is voted the Most Valuable Player in the National League this year , he will be the first major leaguer to win it four times . And with career totals of 494 homers and 471 stolen bases , Bonds , the San Francisco Giants ' left fielder , is the only player in baseball history with more than 400 in each category .</s>
<s>But if Reggie Jackson was Mr . October for his postseason performances , Barry Bonds is Mr . 0 for October .</s>
<s>When the Giants open their division series against the Mets in San Francisco Wednesday , Bonds will be desperate to do what he has never done in his various postseason appearances : hit for average , hit for power and help his team win . More than anyone else , he knows he has to disprove the rap that he can't hit in the big one .</s>
<s>He 's tried to laugh it off . ``Call me Mr. July ,'' he once said . Or feel free to call him Mr . August or Mr . September .</s>
<s>When the season ended Sunday , Bonds had batted .306 , crashed a career-high 49 home runs and driven in 106 runs .</s>
<s>But over 23 postseason games in his career  20 with the Pirates nearly a decade ago in three losing National League Championship Series and three with the Giants in a 1997 division series sweep by the Florida Marlins  Bonds has batted only .200 (16 for 80 ) with only one home run , only four doubles , only five runs batted in and 16 strikeouts .</s>
<s>In those three NL Championship Series , two against the Atlanta Braves (in which he batted .148 in 1991 and .261 in '92 ) and one against the Cincinnati Reds (.167 in '90 ), his overall average was .191 .</s>
<s>Even with his overall .200 postseason average , Bonds has not even hit his weight , 210 . And his team , whether the Pirates or the Giants , has lost 15 of those 23 postseason games .</s>
<s>Over a short postseason series , even the best hitters sometimes wallow through a slump as their team loses . Babe Ruth batted .118 (two for 17 ) in the five-game 1922 World Series that the Yankees lost to the New York Giants . But over 23 postseason games , the cream is supposed to rise to the top . Bonds ' cream has only curdled . To his dismay .</s>
<s>``I want people to say ,'' he has often proclaimed , ``that Barry Bonds is the best baseball player there is .''</s>
<s>If you just assess his career regular-season stats , you can argue that he is the best baseball player there is .</s>
<s>He was named The Sporting News player of the decade for the 1990s over Ken Griffey Jr . and Mark McGwire , joining such prestigious names as Stan Musial ('40s ), Ted Williams ('50s ), Willie Mays ('60s ), Pete Rose ('70s ) and Mike Schmidt ('80s ). In 10 years of MVP voting in the '90s , he received the most points  1,895 , nearly 500 more than the next highest vote-getter , Frank Thomas of the Chicago White Sox .</s>
<s>By rule , the MVP votes must be cast in the brief interlude between the end of the regular season and the start of the playoffs . So Bonds ' postseason flops never counted against his MVP credentials .</s>
<s>Those MVP votes were a tribute to the integrity of baseball writers who cast those votes ; few , if any , find Bonds to be endearing or charming . For that matter , few of his teammates have enjoyed his arrogant , haughty personality .</s>
<s>``I 'd rather lose without him ,'' one of his Pirate teammates said , requesting anonymity , ``than win with him .''</s>
<s>Bonds hasn't changed . Many of his Giant teammates hardly talk to him . Or want to . In the Giants ' spacious clubhouse at their new Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco , he prefers to be alone . He spreads out across four lockers . He sprawls in a recliner and watches his own television set or listens to his stereo .</s>
<s>``Some people accuse me of having a chip on my shoulder ,'' he once said , ``but that 's part of what makes me tick .''</s>
<s>But more than anyone else , Bonds knows he has not ticked in the postseason . He 's due to break out with a barrage against the Mets ; then again , the Mets ' pitchers know that , in his desperation to show that he really is the ``best player there is ,'' he might be willing to swing at pitches he might ignore during the regular season . If he does swing at those pitches , that should be to the Mets ' advantage , not his .</s>
<s>``If you know me ,'' Barry Bonds once said , ``I always find something that I have to prove .''</s>
<s>In this postseason , he has to prove that he 's much more than a .200 hitter .</s>
