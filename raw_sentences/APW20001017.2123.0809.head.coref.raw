<s>Astronauts Install Power Equipment</s>
<s>CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla . (AP )  Two spacewalking astronauts clamped power equipment onto the international space station on Tuesday and inadvertently added to the collection of junk whizzing around Earth .</s>
<s>A cap for a depressurization valve floated away moments after Bill McArthur emerged from space shuttle Discovery .</s>
<s>The aluminum cover , about the size of a gas cap on a car , bounced against the space station , then against the shuttle robot arm . Then it was gone .</s>
<s>``It was a nice billiard shot ,'' McArthur radioed . ``It 's become the latest addition to tiny bodies orbiting the Earth .''</s>
<s>Mission Control said the lost cap was no reason for concern . Its tether either came loose or broke .</s>
<s>The main purpose of Tuesday 's spacewalk  the third in as many days  was to mount two power converters on the space station 's new aluminum framework , or truss .</s>
<s>Astronaut Leroy Chiao performed the job from the end of Discovery 's robot arm . He removed the 175-pound converters one by one from the shuttle cargo bay . From inside the shuttle , Michael Lopez-Alegria used the robot arm to give Chiao a lift .</s>
<s>The converters will be used to regulate power once a pair of solar wings  stretching 240 feet from tip to tip  are installed during the next construction mission , in December .</s>
<s>Chiao and McArthur clearly enjoyed their 240-mile-high construction work .</s>
<s>``How would you like to live on this thing for a few months ?'' McArthur asked .</s>
<s>``I think that would be pretty cool ,'' Chiao replied .</s>
<s>By the time the seven-hour spacewalk ended , the two had completed all their cable connections , toolbox work and other chores .</s>
<s>One spacewalk remains . On Wednesday , Lopez-Alegria and Jeff Wisoff will go back out to clean the top of the truss for the arrival of the solar wings , test their mini jetpacks and practice carrying each other . NASA wants to see how hard it would be for a spacewalker to rescue an incapacitated colleague .</s>
<s>When Discovery pulls away Friday , it will leave behind 10 tons of new space station pieces .</s>
<s>The station 's first permanent crew is supposed to arrive in early November .</s>
