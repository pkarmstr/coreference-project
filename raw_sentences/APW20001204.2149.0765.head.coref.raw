<s>Georgia Fires Coach Jim Donnan</s>
<s>ATHENS , Ga . (AP )  Georgia fired football coach Jim Donnan Monday after a disappointing 7-4 season that started with the Bulldogs ranked No . 10 and picked to win the SEC East , his players said .</s>
<s>``I thought he would be around another year ,'' said quarterback Cory Phillips , who was at a team meeting at which Donnan told the team he had been dismisssed . ``I 'm a little bit shocked . It 's an unsettling feeling .''</s>
<s>Athletic director Vince Dooley had given Donnan a vote of confidence just last month . But the players said Dooley told them that school president Michael Adams made the decision to fire Donnan .</s>
<s>The athletic department scheduled a late afternoon to discuss the program but details were not disclosed .</s>
<s>Dooley said last month the coach would not be fired even though the Bulldogs fell short of preseason predictions that had them winning SEC 's East .</s>
<s>Criticism of Donnan increased a week later , after Georgia Tech beat Georgia for the third straight year , the Bulldogs ' longest losing streak in the bitter rivalry since the early 1960s .</s>
<s>A win over Georgia Tech would have put Georgia in position for a New Year 's Day bowl game , but the loss left the No . 24 Bulldogs in the Oahu Bowl against Virginia .</s>
<s>Phillips said players asked Dooley if Donnan could coach the team in the bowl game . If not , Phillips said , players were considering voting against accepting the bid .</s>
<s>The 55-year-old Donnan , who came to Georgia for the 1996 season from Division I-AA Marshall , has been linked to coaching vacancies the past three years .</s>
<s>Donnan has a career record of 103-40 , including 39-19 at Georgia . He has failed , however , against Georgia 's biggest rivals , going 6-14 against Georgia Tech , Florida , Auburn and Tennessee .</s>
<s>``Obviously you 're expected at the University of Georgia to beat the big rivals ,'' Phillips said . ``We do have a losing record against them .''</s>
<s>He rejected a five-year , $4.25-million offer from North Carolina in 1997 , and was said to be a candidate the following season at Oklahoma , where he was a former assistant . The North Carolina job is open again after Carl Torbush was fired earlier this year .</s>
<s>Donnan is a native of Burlington , N.C. , and played at North Carolina State .</s>
