<s>Rabanne Fashion Has Silver Lining</s>
<s>PARIS (AP )  Paco Rabanne 's Monday show of ready-to-wear for summer 2001 was shiny , young and happy . He decided that fashion has a silver lining  and exterior , as well .</s>
<s>The designer was expected to retire a couple of seasons ago , but he only gave up haute couture , and threw his well-known talents for chain-mail and sequins into boutique clothes .</s>
<s>With a waterfall background , the models paraded by in gold or silver disc dresses , super slithery silver metallic bikinis , wraps and micro-mini dresses or hot pants . Well over sixty , Rabanne still has an eye for the younger circuit .</s>
<s>The smooth caramel imitation leather outfits with nailheads  jackets , flared pants and more  were remarkable . Also entertaining was the bikini in tortoise-shell-patterned plastic discs .</s>
<s>Bare midriffs and trousers flared and split halfway up the leg looked zingy . Of course , there were hot pants , in glitzy metallics and soft leather , and there were metal hip belts or breastplate neckwear galore .</s>
<s>Softwear here included geometrics on striped minis in little crepe or organza dresses , some good trouser outfits with plastic or metal adorning halter-neck toppers .</s>
<s>For eye-popping specials , Rabanne came out with plenty of fluorescent green and orange , quite fun for the disco in a rhodoid disc-decorated minidress with matching bag .</s>
<s>The long silky and tulle black ballerina outfits were a sober note , though the sandals were interesting  heels only , clinging to the foot , with a ring on a toe .</s>
<s>Dries van Noten also produced an amusing , appealing collection that stood as a feminine moment .</s>
<s>The flowered skirts in sun pleats , the interesting striped jackets in Indian silk , teamed with shiny black and white patent high-heeled pumps , looked partly retro , but eminently wearable .</s>
<s>Low-keyed glamour here included flapper looks in low-belted outfits with short pleated skirts , some super sailor -style trouser outfits with fluid ivory or white pants and little jackets and striped shirts .</s>
<s>Prints for the georgette crepes and chiffons were often wonderful . They looked like watercolors of arbors or fantasy flowers . Ruffles peeping out here and there from skirts or on tops added more feminine touches .</s>
<s>Dresses in hibiscus-embroidered fabrics , large chiffon shawls with floral embroideries , boxy silk jackets and the hipster pants all made for a fine offering .</s>
<s>Gaspard Yurkievitch , a young French designer , showing in the Petit Palais , could make the grade in some stores with his offhand styles that some find cool but that lacked sex appeal .</s>
<s>A black bathing suit with a fawn suede jacket with nailhead snaps was followed by skinny fawn trousers with plenty of bare midriff showing under the black bra .</s>
<s>Then things went into the puffy , baggy lines , the latest look-back-to-Eighties styles seen on some runways . In cotton satins and other fabrics , Yurkievitch showed pants with baggy bottoms , skirts with bubbly effects and some odd ruffles around armholes . These often came in colors like magenta or brown .</s>
<s>Even harem pants or a totally topless number with lacy black pants and bikini bottoms failed to lure .</s>
